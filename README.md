Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The code given was the eligible actions the pirate (agent) can take, and the layout of the map (game environment). The code that needed to be created was the learning algorithm the
pirate used in order to autonomously navigate its environment in order to solve the map and reach the treasure while avoiding obstacles.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are responsible for creating solutions to a multitude of problems or inefficiencies. In this course, we specifically tackled the need for computer scientists to
create deep learning algorithms to enhance artificial intelligence.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
My approach to a problem as a computer scientist will be to initially analyze the existing policies that are in place, or to evaluate possible policies that I may implement. Then, 
I will evaluate the outcomes from said policies based on the outcomes from the system.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilites that I have to the end user and the organization is to ensure data is kept safe, there is a minimum amount of information collected in order to achieve 
the predetermined goal, and to provide effective solutions to the problems that I have been tasked to deal with.
